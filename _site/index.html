<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Skytron was built to detect anomalous flight paths. However, it has a general use as a pipeline to analyze data as a stream and to train a model as a stream. Skytron learns to predict flight paths using the real-time data from the Open Sky Network. With the premise that anomalous flights will be harder to predict, the model logs anomalies based on prediction error.</p>

<h2 id="stream-vs-batch">Stream Vs Batch</h2>
<p>Skytron’s real-time anomaly detection allows immediate detection of problems and thus faster (cheaper) error correction. In the absence of historical data, rather than wait for a sufficiently sized batch you can hit the ground running and train off each piece of data as it comes in. This also saves on storage, because instead of requiring a large stored batch of training data, the model trains as a loop, continuously overwriting a small pool of data.</p>

<h2 id="training-loop">Training Loop</h2>
<p>The training loop makes an API call to the Open Sky Network collecting a flight vector (Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, Velocity, Heading) for every flight in the network; waits 10 seconds to collect a second set of vectors; then trains on the two sets; then predicts off the second set and overwrites the first for new set, evaluates prediction against new set, log errors, overwrites second set with newer set and repeats by training on the two new sets. To help clarify, see the diagram below.</p>

<h2 id="threading">Threading</h2>
<p>While the training loop runs, I want to view current anomalies, extract a dictionary of all anomalies detected and extract the trained model once stable. I also want to display a streaming set of plots for model evaluation. Threading enables these process to run concurrently on the same set of variables. My diagram below may be helpful. Each box is an individual thread. I can extract from the Global variables in two ways…</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>Skytron’s general framework is simple and modular, so it can be applied to various applications. For example, I could use a tensor instead of a vector and convolutional neural net instead of a multilayer perceptron to detect anomalies in video streams instead of flight paths. One thing that shouldn’t change is the use of a neural net. Otherwise, we need a function comparing deviation in say latitude compared to deviation velocity. A neural net saves us from this, because its algorithm, backpropagation, will not optimize for one variable over another, so the errors will be on similar scales. We can then reasonably take an average of errors for each prediction and use it to check for anomalies.</p>

<h2 id="streaming-model-evaluation-plots">Streaming Model Evaluation Plots</h2>
<p>With streaming data, there is no classic train test split because were are not waiting around for batches to accumulate and worse we don’t have data labels. To evaluate the model, I created two live streaming plots and then judged if the results matched expectations. Below, at the early stage, the model is unstable with high error. I am not confident. Later, the model stabilizes and there is less variance in the anomalies detected. I have more confidence. The results still do not make perfect sense, there were not 1,000 anomalous flights, at least in a meaningful sense. This could be an artifact of the anomaly criterion being just one standard deviation. If I used three, the result might be more in line with what I am looking for.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add the ability to run multiple models at once, select for the best performing model.</li>
  <li>Be able to tune anomaly criteria, in certain cases we might want to catch more or fewer anomalies</li>
  <li>Test on a different kind of data stream with a different neural net. Ex. Golf swing video</li>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>YouTopics allows the user to quickly analyze the relevance of a YouTube video. Given a user-generated list of keywords representing a topic, YouTopics measures the similarity between the user’s topic and a youtube video’s topic.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>YouTube has a lot of information that can be analyzed with natural language processing thanks to transcripts and auto-generated captions. Despite its popularity, I was unable to find example projects working with this information and so it appears youtube is a largely untouched trove of human communication waiting to be processed.</p>

<h3 id="final-product">Final Product</h3>
<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/youtopics.png" alt="Image test" />
 YouTopics was built to be a web app, but the word embeddings file is too large to be hosted by services like Heroku and Google’s app engine. I can host it by opening up an AWS server. If I end up doing so a link will be posted here.</p>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>
<p>My idea is to extract a summary of the transcripts or captions and then provide an appropriate topic label. The go-to topic models are LDA - and SVD -.</p>

<h4 id="lda">LDA:</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>LDA takes a collection of documents and with an assumed number of topics, assumed distribution of topics across documents and assumed distribution of words across topics, generates, based on probability, a collection of words representing topics. Intuitively, given the high variance of topics and distributions across billions of videos, LDA won’t generalize well with so many assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="svd">SVD</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>I actually really like SVD, which is also known as the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. It’s the base technique for many analytical methods. When applied to NLP it is often referred to as LSA-Latent Semantic Analysis. SVD takes a matrix, in this case, a term by document matrix, and decomposes it into three matrices, a term by topics, topic by topic and topic by doc matrix. Once again, however, the number of topics is guessed or assumed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both methods take a sample of documents to generate word lists representing topics. Finding a sample large enough to generalize these models to all of YouTube would be impractical. So, I came up with a different approach.</p>

<p>Considering the outcome of LDA and SVD is just a list of keywords representing a topic and the python library Gensim has a built-in TextRank algorithm that extracts keywords for a given document. I used these keywords to represent topics and I then assign a label based on the similarity of the keywords with pre-established topic keywords. I  used pre-trained word vectors to compute this similarity.</p>

<h4 id="word-vectors">Word Vectors</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Word2Vec and GLoVe word embedding map words to vector space where the distance between words relates semantic similarity. With Word2Vec, the semantic similarity is computed by taking the parameters from a neural network prediction of surrounding words. GloVe uses a more direct approach, GloVe’s objective is to predict the log probability of word occurrence across the whole corpus. GloVe’s approach produces generally better results than Word2Vec, though it is more difficult to train. Since I am going to using pre-trained models anyway, I decided to use GloVe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have determined a method to extract keywords and compare them. The last step is to extract a summary.
NLP summary methods are divided into extractive and abstractive methods. Abstraction uses a lot of computing power to make new summary sentences. I prefer the extraction method, which forms summaries by just pulling important sentences from the document. It effectively conveys the same meaning while using less computing power. Gensim has an inbuilt summarizer based on BM25 along with TextRank.</p>

<h4 id="textrank">TextRank</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Is the same algorithm as PageRank, assigns rank based on the unique number of links. In TextRank, links are words in immediate proximity.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="bm25">BM25</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ranks sentences based on the inverse frequency and frequency of keywords from TextRank. BM25
is still obscure to me but it seems intuitively linked to the idea information entropy. A sentence value is based not just on the frequency of keywords, but the information value the keywords have in the sentence. Regardless, the results pass the eye test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next step is to extract the transcripts from youtube. This can be done through the youtube API. There is always a kind soul in the python communities who will implement a python version of popular API’s. In this case, I found PyTube.</p>

<h4 id="pytube">PyTube</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Works great. Thanks, stranger.<a href="https://github.com/nficano/pytube">Link to the repo</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>
<p>Add a database storage function for user-defined topics. Then apply a database of topics for more robust topic analysis. Add multi-topic
analysis functionality.</p>
