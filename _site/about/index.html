  Hi! I'm Andrew Portal, a Data Scientist. This means I know Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, and Statistics, but mainly I spend my time writing code tying these fields together into some application. Feel free to reach out if have any questions about my work or are interested in collaborating. (...hiring me)

<h3 id="grit--grid">Grit &amp; Grid?</h3>
<p>In machine learning, grid search refers to cycling through all the hyper-parameters of a model to find the optimum set. Grit comes into play because not everything can be grid searched, so eventually I employ an exhaustive manual process of trial and error. These words illustrate how I build machine learning application, but most crucially they form an alliteration.</p>

<h3 id="who-am-i-why-i-am-here">Who am I? Why I am here?</h3>

<p>I enjoy finding a better way of doing things. I initially used programing to automate task. I moved to San Francisco to be with my girlfriend who is attending UCSF medical school. Here I learned, through the power of machine learning, I can use programming to not only automate but enable feats previously impossible. For example, I met a group who were using EEG information along with ML to detect emotional states and then build a VR environment to respond. Rather than just automate a process a human can do manually, ML enables a new frontier of possibilities. After discovering this, I am confident in what I want to do with my time.</p>

<h3 id="some-fun-facts">Some fun facts.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Enjoy sports, particularly basketball, golf, tennis</li>
  <li>Like watching shows and movies, though I am often dissatisfied with the ending</li>
  <li>Girlfriend and I are happy.</li>
  <li>Came to San Francisco via a cross country road trip, which was pretty cool</li>
</ul>
