  Hi! I'm Andrew Portal, a Data Scientist. This means I know Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, and Statistics, but mainly I spend my time writing code tying these fields together into some application. Feel free to reach out if have any questions about my work or are interested in collaborating (or hiring me!).

### Grit & Grid?
In machine learning, grid search refers to cycling through all the hyper-parameters of a model to find the optimum set. Grit comes into play because not everything can be grid searched, so eventually I employ an exhaustive manual process of trial and error. These words illustrate how I build machine learning applications, and happen to form a nice alliteration.

### Who am I? Why I am here?
I am in continual pursuit of a better way of doing things. While working in an Excel-based role as a project analyst for several years after graduating, I began learning programming to automate my work tasks. I quit my job in summer 2018 when I moved to San Francisco with my girlfriend who is attending UCSF medical school, and spent the end of 2018 focused on self-study of programming, which is how I encountered machine learning. 

I learned that through the power of machine learning, I can use programming to not only automate established tasks but also enable feats previously impossible. For example, one group I met is using EEG information along with ML to detect emotional states and then build a VR environment to respond. Rather than just automate a process a human can do manually, ML enables a new frontier of possibilities. After discovering this, I was confident in what I wanted to do with my time.

I enrolled in Metis, a data science training program I completed Jan-Mar 2019. Along the way Iâ€™ve learned a lot and compiled several projects, which I have tried to describe and share in this blog.


### Some fun facts about me.

* Enjoy sports, particularly basketball, golf, tennis
* Like watching shows and movies, though I am often dissatisfied with the ending
* Came to San Francisco from Virginia via a cross country road trip, which was pretty cool
