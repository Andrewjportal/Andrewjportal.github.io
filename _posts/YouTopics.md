# Overview
		YouTopics allows the user to quickly analyze the relevance of a video. <br>
		Given a user-generated list of keywords representing a topic,<br>
		YouTopics measures the similarity between the user's topic<br>
		and a youtube video's topic.

# Method
		A TextRank algorithm is used to extract keywords and summary sentences <br>
		from the video's transcript or autogenerated captions.The keywords are <br>
		converted to word vectors from pre-trained GloVe word embeddings. <br>
		The word vectors are summed and then compared to a vector derived<br>
		from the user's keywords using cosine similarity.

#Future Work
		Add a database storage function for user defined topics. Then apply <br>
		database of topics for more robust topic analysis. Add multi-topic <br>
		analysis functionality.
