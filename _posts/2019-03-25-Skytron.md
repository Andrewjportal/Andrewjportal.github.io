title: Skytron

***
## Overview
Skytron was built to detect anomalous flight paths in the Open Sky Network. However, it has a general use as a pipeline to analyze data as a stream and to train a model as a stream.

## Stream Vs Batch
Anomaly detection is best in real time, as stream. If there is problem, the more time passes the greater the potential cost to fix. If you already have data as stream, then train the model as stream for the same consideration, timeliness. Rather than wait for a sufficiently sized batch, just hit the ground running and train each piece of data as it comes in. This also all saves on storage, because rather than train on singular large batch, the model trains as continuous loop overwriting a small piece of data.


## Training Loop
The training loop makes an API call to the Open Sky Network collecting a flight vector (Longitude, Latitude, Altitude, Velocity, Heading) for ever flight in the network, waits 10 seconds and collect a second set of vectors, then trains on the two set; then predicts off the second set and overwrites the first for new set, evaluates prediction against new set, log errors, overwrites second set with newer set and repeats by train on the two new sets. In case this process was not clear, see the diagram below.

## Threading
While the training loop runs, I want extract information from model, such view current anomalies, extract a dictionary of all anomalies detected and the trained model once it has stabilized. Also, I want to  display a streaming set of plots for model evaluation. Threading enables these process to run in tandem on the same set of variables. If needed, please see this diagram I made.

Each box is a threading process. The ML process generates the data and the other two process are means of interacting with data


## Model
The framework of the model is simple and modular, so in can be applied to various applications. For example,I could use a tensor instead a vector and convolutional neural net instead of a multilayer perceptron to detect anomalous video streams instead of flight paths. The framework remains, so the underlying machinery connecting input and model is the same. One thing that shouldn't change is the use of a neural net. Otherwise, we need a function comparing deviation in say latitude compared to devation velocity. These are variables with different categories with different scales and relating them can be a challenge in itself.  A neural net saves us from this, because its algorithm will not optimize for one variable over another. It internal adjust weights so that all the errors will be on a similar scale and then we can reasonably just take an average.

## Streaming Evaluation Plots
With streaming data there is no classic train test split, because were are not waiting around for batches to accumulate and even more problematic we don't have data labels. To evaluate the model, I created two live streaming plots and just then judged if the results matched expectations. Below, at the early stage the model is unstable, high error, thus I am not confident. Later, the model stabilizes and there is less variance in the anomalies detected, so I have more confidence. The results still do not make perfect sense, there were not 1,000 anomalous flight, at least in a meaningful sense. This could be artifact of the anomaly criterion being just one standard deviation. If were to check with three, the result might be more line with what I am looking for.

## Future Work
* Add the ability to run multiple models at once, select for the best performing model.
* Be able tune anomaly criteria, in certain cases we might want to catch more or fewer anomalies
* Test on a different kind of data stream with a different neural net. Ex. Golf swing video
